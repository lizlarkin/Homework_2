The responsive layout project was intended to demonstrate how layouts can automatically changed based on the screen size/viewer. 
Bootstrap does this so well that it's actually hard to understand what is really happening behind the scenes. 

This project took a lot of trial and error to get a feel for how Bootstrap can be adapted, but also how it can't. I initially 
tried to combine Bootstrap elements and found that I was breaking its responsive abilities. It was also challenging to talk to
Bootstrap via my own CSS, because it's difficult to identify the HTML tags to use for communication. Often times I was trying
to access the element using the wrong name, or I had correctly accessed the element but Bootstrap was overpowering my CSS. 
Ultimately I tried to avoid using !important too often, but it was a great tool for testing whether or not I was really communicating. 

For the life of me I still cannot figure out why I'm added extra white space beyond the size of the rows I've established. Hours and hours
of playing around with the code has me completely stumped.
