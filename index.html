                            I was born in 2008 in Mendocino County, and brought to the San Francisco SPCA with my mom and seven brothers and sisters. 
                            We were dubbed the "Sesame Street" litter, so my original name was Grover. My human mom adopted me when I was 8 weeks old, 
                            and renamed me Donner. When my human dad met my human mom, he pointed out how horrible the name Donner is and assembled a 
                            long list of nicknames: Donnie, Donnie Baseball, Donnie B, 360 Donnie, Big Don, Big Yawn, Low Tide Don (a reference to my 
                            breath - I don't understand this one), D Dog, etc. etc.
                        </p>    
                        <p>    
                            The picture shown here is from one of my favorite days of all time. My human mom and dad dressed up real nice and threw 
                            some kind of party -- whatever the occassion, the prime rib remains forever cemented in my memory. 
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            My human parents recently had my DNA analyzed, and found that I'm 33% Pit Bull, 14% Australian Cattle Dog, 14% Labrador, 
                            10% Siberian Husky, 9% German Shepherd, 6% American Staffordshire Terrier, 4% Boerboel, and 9% Supermutt. My Supermutt 
                            Super Power is expeditiously clearing humans out of rooms with my farts.
