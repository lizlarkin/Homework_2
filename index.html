                            I was born in 2008 in Mendocino County, and brought to the San Francisco SPCA with my mom and seven brothers and sisters. We were dubbed the "Sesame Street" litter, so my original name was Grover. My human mom adopted me when I was 6 weeks old, and renamed me Donner. When my human dad met my human mom, he pointed out how horrible the name Donner is and assembled a long list of nicknames: Donnie, Donnie Baseball, Donnie B, 360 Donnie, Big Don, etc. etc."

                        <p>    
                            The picture shown here is from one of my favorite days of all time. My human mom and dad dressed up real nice and threw some kind of party that people say was important -- all I can remember is the prime rib.

                            My human parents recently had my DNA tested, and found that I'm 33% Pit Bull, 14% Australian Cattle Dog, 14% Labrador, 10% Siberian Husky, 9% German Shepherd, 6% American Staffordshire Terrier, 4% Boerboel, and 9% Supermutt.
